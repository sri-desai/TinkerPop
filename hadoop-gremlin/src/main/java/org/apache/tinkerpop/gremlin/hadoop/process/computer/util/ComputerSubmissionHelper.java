     * which is used by {@link CompletableFuture#supplyAsync(Supplier)} (among other methods).
     * The single threaded executor created by this method contains a thread
     * with the same context classloader and thread group as the thread that called
     * this method.  Threads created in this method also have predictable behavior when
     * {@link Thread#setContextClassLoader(ClassLoader)} is invoked; threads in the
     * common pool throw a SecurityException if the JVM has a security manager configured.
     * <p>

     * <ul>
