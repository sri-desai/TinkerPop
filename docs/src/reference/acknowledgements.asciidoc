Gremlin and his friends for TinkerPop was one of my first major projects as a freelancer, and it's delightful to
see them on the Web and all over the documentation! Drawing and tweaking the characters over time is like watching
them grow up. They've gone from sketches on paper to full-color logos, and from logos to living characters that
cheerfully greet visitors to the TinkerPop website. And it's been a great time all throughout!

...in the beginning.
